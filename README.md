# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Project Outline

Website for fictional marketing company "Horiseon", refactored to conform with accessibility standards so that it is optimized for search engines. 

## Design Notes

* Includes alt attributes in line with accessibility guidlines, including empty alt attributes for decorative icons that lack functionality (i.e. are not links)

* Title designed to be both concise and descriptive, capturing the company name and main service/area of expertise (digital marketing)
